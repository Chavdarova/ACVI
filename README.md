---------------------------

The repository contains:
- `ACVI_2d_experiments.ipynb`: [Colab-notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/) to reproduce the results on 2D problems. 
- `ACVI_Higher_dimension_bg.ipynb`: [Colab-notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/) to reproduce the results on the higher dimensional bilinear game constrained on the simplex.
